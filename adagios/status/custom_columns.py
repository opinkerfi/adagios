"""
This module looks up and stores Livesatus columns, organised per table,
and stored along with their name, type and description.
Access the data using:
>>> from adagios.status import custom_columns
>>> cols = custom_columns.all_columns

As a sidenote, columns for a specific table can be obtained with this oneliner:
$ printf 'GET columns' | netcat localhost 50000 | awk -F ';' '{if ($3 == "hosts") {print $2}}'
The Filter clause is not implemented in Shinken for the Columns table,
thus forcing us to post-process the data.
