Datatable v1.0.3
=========

Datatable is a jQuery plugin for dynamic datatables with pagination, filtering and ajax loading.

How to use?
===========

Datatable is quite simple to use. Just add the CSS and Js file to your page (do not forget jquery):
`<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script>` 
`<script type="text/javascript" src="js/datatable.js"></script>`

And run:
`$('#MyTable').datatable() ;`

If you use bootstrap CSS, you can use datatable-boostrap.css instead of datatable.css (which is just the datatable-bootstrap.css with some additional style).

How to modify CSS?
==================

The datatable plugin come with small CSS files, one for non-bootstrap theme and others for bootstrap theme. These CSS files does not modify tables skin, they just:

1. Add background-img to sorting header
2. Add margin to ajax load bar
3. Create skin for pagination div (non-boostrap only)
4. Create skin for ajax loading bar (non-boostrap only)

Bootstrap CSS files use bootstrap pagination div and loading bar.

<strong>Warning: </strong> If you use bootstrap 3, you need to manually set the <code>pagingListClass</code> and <code>pagingDivClass</code> options to match bootstrap 3 pagination classes.

If you want to add a theme, do not hesitate to send me a mail! If you need more information on how to customize table CSS, do not hesitate to contact me.
